# News_explorer

This app allows end users to view top news of the day. I developed it using the public NewsAPI, which uses the URL "https://newsapi.org/v2". 

To run the app, first clone the repo using this command
```
git clone https://github.com/Eliane-M/country_explorer.git
```
```
cd shoping_cart
```
```
cd shopping_cart_app
```
then run this command to install dependencies
```
flutter pub get
```
then run the app on an emulator using
```
flutter run
```
